# Graph-Theory
Graph Theory Implementation in C++ (Object-Oriented)
This project showcases my implementation of various graph theory algorithms in C++, employing an object-oriented approach. By leveraging object-oriented design principles, I have structured the codebase to promote modularity, reusability, and maintainability. 
The implementation includes a collection of graph algorithms, such as breadth-first search, depth-first search, shortest paths(Dijkstra), and minimum spanning trees(Prim and Kruskal.
